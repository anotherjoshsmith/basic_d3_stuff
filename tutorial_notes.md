# some stuff
**models.js** is a library built by Curran
tons of libraries based on d3... 
dc.js lets you link plots together interactively, could be important for our project.

covering examples similar to *let's make a barchart* tutorial

*d3 script* is sorta just a patchwork of html, javascript, and css. 

**jsbin.com** for prototyping. play w example code and see output quickly.

##Examples

need to set the size of an svg element itself...
starting in the top left for x=0, y=0 makes sense from the stand point of building a page up from scratch
coo... don't use rgb thooo

z at the end of path specification closes the path!

move stuff together by grouping with **g** tag, transfrom and translate
To resize... write some javascript to look for certain event to trigger resize.

use google fonts to manipulate text style
